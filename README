# Not Alone - Online Multiplayer Board Game

A web adaptation of the board game *Not Alone*, built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **AWS**.  
Supports both **single-player (vs AI)** and **real-time multiplayer** modes.

This is a side project I built over the course of a month to explore:
- 🧩 Real-time multiplayer logic with WebSockets  
- ☁️ Serverless backend infrastructure  
- ♻️ Scalable game state management

> 🚧 **Note:** The game is still in development. Some cards and features are not fully implemented yet, and the UI is in a rough early stage. Feedback welcome!
